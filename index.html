<h2>Song History</h2>

<p>
"Sweet Child O' Mine" is one of the most iconic rock songs ever recorded by Guns N' Roses.
It was released in 1987 as part of their debut album <b>Appetite for Destruction</b>, an album
that would later become the best-selling debut album in rock history.
</p>

<p>
The song began almost accidentally. Guitarist Slash was practicing a warm-up exercise
during a rehearsal session. What he considered a "joke riff" caught the attention of the band.
Drummer Steven Adler and bassist Duff McKagan started improvising a rhythm section,
and the jam quickly evolved into a full song.
</p>

<p>
Axl Rose then wrote the lyrics as a tribute to his girlfriend Erin Everly.
Unlike many hard-rock songs of the era, the lyrics were unusually emotional,
nostalgic and sincere, focusing on love, childhood memories and vulnerability.
This contrast helped the song stand out from the glam metal scene of the late 1980s.
</p>

<p>
When the album was first released, the band did not expect this track to become a major single.
However, radio stations began playing it heavily, and in 1988 the song reached
<b>#1 on the Billboard Hot 100</b>.
</p>

<p>
The music video also became a staple on MTV. Instead of a cinematic storyline,
the band chose to show rehearsal footage. This gave audiences a raw, authentic look
at the group and strengthened their image as a real rock band rather than a glam production.
</p>

<p>
Today, the opening guitar riff is widely considered one of the most recognizable riffs in rock history.
The song remains a defining anthem of the late 1980s and a cornerstone of Guns N' Roses' legacy.
